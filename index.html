						<h2>How I got here<h2>

					</div>
				
						<p> Brian is an entrepreneur looking to do something he cares about and make an impact.
						</p>

						<p> In year 6 of what ended up being an 8 year career in finance Brian started to get really interested in the idea of startups.  The prospect of working on something new, making an impact, and actually enjoying work was an appealing idea.
						</p>

						<p>Brian first got involved by investing in a couple of startups.  Eventually, he launched his own and worked on it as a side project.  Finally, in January of 2013 he left his finance job in order to focus full time on pursuing a new career.
						</p>

						<p>To help push this new career forward Brian enrolled in the Startup Institute in October 2013.  Brian is learning to be a full stack Technical Marketer while at SIC and would love to bring an anytical marketing approach to a startup he really believes in.
