					<p> I live in Chicago with my wife, Liz, and cat, Packy (yes, I have a cat).  Liz and I have been married 5 years and change our minds daily about when to have kids and if/when we want to move to the suburbs.  I worked in finace for 8 years before finally quitting to pursue a more entrepreneurial career.  My goal is to continue investing in start-ups while also adding value by being able to work closely with those companies I invest in.
