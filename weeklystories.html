						<h2> Week 1 - nuggets from three startup founders<h2>

					</div>

						<p>Week 1 of <a href="http://startupinstitute.com/">Startup Institute Chicago</a>  saw three founders come through to say hi and share some insights.  While each gave amazing talks and shared a lot of wisdom with us the below are the standout pieces of advice I took away from each.
							<p>
 
						<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanaustin">Ethan Austin</a> of <a href="http://www.giveforward.com/">Give Forward</a> suggested the best startups clearly understand why they are in business.  It is pretty easy to identify what a company does and how they do it.  Give Forward, for example, is an online fundraising site that makes it easy to rally around a person in need by donating money toward their medical cause.  Ethan suggests, though, that understanding the reason they provide that service is critical to maintaining a great culture and team.  In their case the why is to "create unexpected joy."  He suggested that as we start considering job opportunities we should spend time really understanding not only what the company does and how they do it, but why they do it in the first place.

						<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/rickdesai">Rick Desai</a> of <a href="http://www.dashfire.com/#slide-main">Dashfire</a> had us work on our own personal "elevator pitch‚Äù that we can use at networking events.  He suggests you need to be concise and to the point, but be interesting enough that the person remembers you. The best way to do this, Rick says, is to know your audience so you can tailor your story to be more meaningful to the person.  Here's more or less what I said to Rick when I approached him after the talk - "I worked in finance for eight years.  Around year 6 I started to get the startup bug. I invested in a couple and finally quit my job this past January to launch my own.  While it's still operating it didn't really take off as I'd planned so I enrolled at Startup Institute to improve my skills and get better at it."  Rick said my story and delivery was pretty good, but that I should go into the conversation with a specific ask in mind so that there is a takeaway.
							<p>
 
						<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/David_Gardner">Dave Gardner</a> of <a href="http://colorjar.com/">Color Jar</a> did a more informal chat where he told us about his background and answered any questions we had.  Dave was full of perfect metaphors describing his take on running a startup.  My favorite had to do with customer acquisition.  Dave said most companies, when launching, are thinking about how they can get 10,000 customers.  He likened this to trying to figure out how you can fill up the United Center.  The best approach, in his mind, is to look for that one crazy fan that will show up with his face painted waving a huge foam finger around.  He'll be so energetic and having such a good time that others wont be able to help but follow along. He stressed that we need to think really hard about who our customers are and focus on making the experience amazing for those first core customers.

						<p>These guys set a really high bar for future founders coming to visit us over the next 7 weeks - I can't wait.
